# Many-to-One-LSTM-for-Sentiment-Analysis-and-Text-Generation
In this LSTM Project , we will build develop a sentiment detection model using many-to-one LSTMs for accurate prediction of sentiment labels in airline text reviews. Additionally, we will also train many-to-one LSTMs on 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' to generate contextually relevant text.
